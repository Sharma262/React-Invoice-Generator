## 📌 Description

My friend recently started his own business and was facing challenges creating invoices manually. To help him, I developed this **Invoice Generator** web application using **React.js**.

It allows users to:
- Fill out invoice details (client, sender, items, tax, etc.)
- Automatically calculate totals
- Download the invoice as a **PDF** in a clean and professional format

Perfect for freelancers, startups, and small business owners.
